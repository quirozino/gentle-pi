**Turn Pi from a powerful coding agent into a controlled development harness.**

`gentle-pi` installs **el Gentleman** in Pi: a senior-architect operating layer for Spec-Driven Development, focused subagents, strict TDD evidence, reviewable work units, safety guards, and project/user skill discovery.

Pi already has strong tools. `gentle-pi` adds the discipline for using them well.

`gentle-pi` is the Pi-native package from the [Gentle-AI ecosystem](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai), built by [Gentleman Programming](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming): the broader open-source project for turning AI coding agents into disciplined engineering environments with SDD workflows, skills, memory integrations, model routing, and review guardrails across multiple agents.

Startup intro collaboration: thanks to [@aporcelli](https://github.com/aporcelli) for [`pi-gentle-startup`](https://github.com/aporcelli/pi-gentle-startup), which inspired the clean-screen startup animation, compact runtime panel, and pink visual treatment.

## The problem

Most coding-agent sessions fail for operational reasons, not model reasons:

- the agent jumps into code before requirements are clear;
- architectural decisions disappear into chat history;
- one request quietly becomes a huge multi-area diff;
- tests run late, or not at all;
- reviewers get handed a wall of changes;
- subagents are available, but the parent session has no orchestration discipline;
- project skills exist, but the model forgets to load them.

`gentle-pi` fixes the workflow around the agent.

## What it adds

| Capability                     | What it does                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **el Gentleman persona**       | Makes Pi behave like a senior architect and teacher, not a generic chatbot. Spanish responses use Rioplatense voseo by default; neutral mode is saved globally with project overrides. |
| **Configurable startup intro** | Adds a rose/text-logo startup intro, compact runtime panel, color presets, and commands to hide or show the decorative parts.                  |
| **Work routing discipline**    | Small tasks stay inline. Context-heavy exploration can be delegated. Large or risky changes go through SDD/OpenSpec.                          |
| **SDD/OpenSpec assets**        | Installs phase agents and chains for `init`, `onboard`, `explore`, `proposal`, `spec`, `design`, `tasks`, `apply`, `verify`, `sync`, and `archive`. |
| **Lazy SDD preflight**         | Asks once per session for SDD mode, artifact store, PR chaining strategy, and review budget before the first SDD flow.                        |
| **Subagent orchestration**     | Keeps one parent session responsible while child agents explore, implement, test, or review with focused context.                             |
| **Strict TDD support**         | When project config declares a test command, apply/verify phases must record RED → GREEN → TRIANGULATE → REFACTOR evidence.                   |
| **Reviewer protection**        | Surfaces review workload risk before a task turns into an oversized PR.                                                                       |
| **Per-agent model assignment** | Pi-native modal for assigning stronger or cheaper models to specific SDD/custom agents.                                                       |
| **Skill discovery registry**   | Maintains `.atl/skill-registry.md` from project and user skills so review/comment/PR workflows do not silently miss the right skill.          |
| **Delivery skills**            | Includes issue-first PRs, chained PRs, work-unit commits, cognitive docs, comment writing, and Judgment Day review.                           |
| **Runtime safety**             | Blocks destructive shell commands, asks for confirmation for sensitive operations, and blocks direct read/write/edit access to sensitive paths. |

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:gentle-pi
```

Recommended companion packages:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-subagents
pi install npm:pi-intercom
pi install npm:gentle-engram
pi install npm:pi-web-access
pi install npm:pi-lens
pi install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-todo
pi install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question
```

Then start Pi in a project:

```bash
pi
```

`gentle-pi` provides SDD agents as global Pi runtime assets, not per-project setup. The first SDD flow in a session still runs a one-time SDD preflight for preferences; for natural-language requests, el Gentleman decides when SDD is needed and runs the explicit preflight first.

## Quick start

```text
/gentle-ai:status          Check package, SDD assets, OpenSpec, and global model config.
/gentle-ai:doctor          Run read-only diagnostics for SDD assets, config, tools, and guards.
/gentle-ai:sdd-preflight   Run or reuse the session SDD preflight explicitly.
/sdd-init                  Create or refresh openspec/config.yaml.
/gentle:models             Assign global model/effort routing to SDD/custom agents.
/gentle:persona            Switch between gentleman and neutral persona modes.
/gentle:banner             Configure startup rose, text logo, and color preset.
```

Typical flow:

1. Open Pi in your repo.
2. Run `/gentle-ai:status`.
3. Run `/sdd-init` once per project, or when test/project capabilities change. This also runs the session SDD preflight.
4. For a substantial change, ask Pi to use SDD. Natural-language requests are classified by the parent agent, not by brittle runtime regexes.
5. Review the phase artifacts instead of trusting floating chat context.

## How the harness decides what to do

`gentle-pi` routes through the smallest safe workflow:

| Request shape                                                               | Harness                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Small, clear, local edit                                                    | Inline direct work.          |
| Unknown codebase area or context-heavy investigation                        | Focused subagent delegation. |
| Large, ambiguous, architectural, product-facing, or high-review-risk change | SDD/OpenSpec flow.           |

The goal is not ceremony. The goal is to avoid accidental chaos. Once a task stops being small, delegation is expected rather than optional.

### Delegation triggers

`gentle-pi` keeps the parent session thin and uses subagents at the narrowest useful point:

| Trigger                                                                                                                     | Expected behavior                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reading 4+ files to understand a flow                                                                                       | Launch `scout` or `context-builder` and synthesize its handoff.      |
| Touching 2+ non-trivial code files                                                                                          | Use one `worker`, or require fresh review before completion.         |
| Commit, push, or PR after code changes                                                                                      | Run a fresh-context `reviewer` unless the diff is trivial docs/text. |
| Wrong cwd, worktree/git accident, merge recovery, confusing test/env issue                                                  | Stop and run a fresh audit reviewer before continuing.               |
| Long monolithic session with accumulating complexity, roughly 20 tool calls, 5 exploratory reads, or 2 non-mechanical edits | Pause and delegate or explain why not.                               |

The intended balanced loop for a bounded bugfix is:

```text
parent git/status + clarify → scout when context-heavy → one worker writes → fresh reviewer audits → parent validates and reports
```

Fresh reviewers are intentionally not token-saving devices; they buy independent judgment. `scout`/`context-builder` save parent context by compressing broad exploration. `worker` preserves a single writer thread.

## SDD/OpenSpec flow

```text
init
  ↓
explore → proposal → spec ─┬→ design ─┐
                            └─────────┴→ tasks → apply → verify → sync → archive
```

The main loop is intentionally file-backed when you choose `openspec` or `both`:

```text
planning artifacts                implementation evidence        canonical update
──────────────────                ───────────────────────        ────────────────
proposal/spec/design/tasks   →    apply-progress/verify-report → sync-report → archive-report
```

For substantial work, the parent session coordinates the flow and each phase writes artifacts. That gives you:

- explicit requirements and non-goals;
- design decisions that survive compaction;
- task plans reviewers can reason about;
- implementation evidence;
- verification reports;
- sync reports that update canonical specs while keeping the change active;
- archive notes for future agents.

Guardrail envelope fields are documented in [`docs/sdd-guardrails.md`](docs/sdd-guardrails.md).

### OpenSpec artifact model

`gentle-pi` treats OpenSpec-compatible behavior as part of the harness. You do not need to install the external OpenSpec CLI/package for SDD.

In file-backed modes, canonical accepted behavior lives in `openspec/specs/`, while active changes carry deltas under `openspec/changes/`:

```text
openspec/
├── specs/                                      # accepted source of truth
│   └── {domain}/spec.md
└── changes/
    ├── {change}/                              # active work
    │   ├── proposal.md
    │   ├── specs/{domain}/spec.md             # full spec or delta spec
    │   ├── design.md
    │   ├── tasks.md
    │   ├── apply-progress.md
    │   ├── verify-report.md
    │   └── sync-report.md
    └── archive/YYYY-MM-DD-{change}/           # immutable audit trail
```

Delta flow:

```text
openspec/changes/{change}/specs/{domain}/spec.md
        │
        │  sdd-sync applies ADDED / MODIFIED / REMOVED
        ▼
openspec/specs/{domain}/spec.md
        │
        │  sdd-archive moves the completed change folder
        ▼
openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-{change}/
```

When a canonical spec already exists, change specs use requirement operation sections:

```markdown
## ADDED Requirements

## MODIFIED Requirements

## REMOVED Requirements
```

`MODIFIED` requirements must include the full requirement block, including still-valid scenarios, because sync replaces the canonical block by requirement name. `sdd-sync` syncs file-backed deltas into `openspec/specs/{domain}/spec.md` while keeping the change active; `sdd-archive` then moves the synced change to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-{change}/`.

Engram-only mode is different by design: Engram is working memory and does not maintain a canonical spec merge layer. Use `openspec` or `both` (hybrid file + memory persistence) when you need canonical spec evolution.

## SDD preflight and project files

`gentle-pi` does not require SDD agents to be copied into every project. The package ensures global Pi SDD assets exist under the Pi agent home and treats project-local files only as overrides/debug copies. Slash SDD flows such as `/sdd-*`, `/sdd-init`, and the explicit `/gentle-ai:sdd-preflight` command run a lazy preflight and ask for session-scoped SDD preferences. For natural-language requests, the parent agent decides whether the work should use SDD and must run/reuse `/gentle-ai:sdd-preflight` before continuing.

```text
~/.pi/agent/agents/sdd-*.md
~/.pi/agent/chains/sdd-*.chain.md
~/.pi/agent/gentle-ai/support/strict-tdd*.md
```

The preflight choices are reused for later SDD flows in the same session:

- execution mode: `interactive` or `auto`;
- artifact store: `openspec`, or `engram`/`both` when callable memory tools are available;
- PR chaining strategy: `auto-forecast`, `ask-always`, `single-pr-default`, or `force-chained`;
- review budget line threshold.

It does **not** overwrite existing global assets unless you explicitly run:

```text
/gentle-ai:install-sdd --force
```

Manual preflight commands:

```text
/gentle-ai:sdd-preflight
/gentle:sdd-preflight
```

## Skill registry

`gentle-pi` keeps a local registry at:

```text
.atl/skill-registry.md
```

The registry scans project and user skill roots, not package-owned skills. It exists to catch workflow skills that are present on disk but not visible in Pi's injected skill list.

It scans common roots such as:

```text
./skills
.opencode/skills
.claude/skills
.gemini/skills
.cursor/skills
.github/skills
.codex/skills
.qwen/skills
.kiro/skills
.openclaw/skills
.pi/skills
.agent/skills
.agents/skills
.atl/skills
~/.pi/agent/skills
~/.config/agents/skills
~/.agents/skills
~/.kimi/skills
~/.config/opencode/skills
~/.config/kilo/skills
~/.claude/skills
~/.gemini/skills
~/.gemini/antigravity/skills
~/.cursor/skills
~/.copilot/skills
~/.codex/skills
~/.codeium/windsurf/skills
~/.qwen/skills
~/.kiro/skills
~/.openclaw/skills
```

Behavior:

- `.atl/` is added to `.gitignore` when needed;
- the registry refreshes on session start;
- startup refresh is skipped when Pi starts with `--no-skills` / `-ns`, `--no-skill-registry`, or `GENTLE_PI_NO_SKILL_REGISTRY=1`;
- `/skill-registry:refresh` forces regeneration;
- a best-effort watcher refreshes when skill files change;
- the registry indexes skill names, full descriptions, scope, and exact `SKILL.md` paths without copying skill body rules.

Skill discovery is a guardrail, not a workflow router: it helps Pi load the right skill without forcing extra ceremony.

Delegation contract:

- parent/orchestrator resolves project/user skills from the registry and passes matching paths under `## Skills to load before work`;
- SDD subagents still use their assigned executor/phase skill;
- during normal runtime, subagents should not independently discover additional project/user `SKILL.md` files or the registry;
- fallback loading is degraded self-healing and must be reported via `skill_resolution` as `fallback-registry`, `fallback-path`, or `none`.

## Persona modes

```text
/gentle:persona
```

| Persona     | Behavior                                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gentleman` | Senior architect, teacher, direct technical feedback, Rioplatense Spanish/voseo when the user writes Spanish. |
| `neutral`   | Same discipline, warmer professional language, no regional expression.                                        |

Saved globally at:

```text
~/.pi/gentle-ai/persona.json
```

A project can still override the global default with:

```text
.pi/gentle-ai/persona.json
```

`/gentle:persona` writes the global config and updates an existing project override when one is present, so the current project does not stay stale. Run `/reload` or start a new Pi session after switching persona.

## Model and effort assignment

```text
/gentle:models
```

The modal discovers:

- project agents in `.pi/agents/` and `.agents/`;
- user agents in `~/.pi/agent/agents/` and `~/.agents/`;
- built-in agents from `pi-subagents`.

Recommended model/effort shape:

| Agent kind                 | Recommended model                                    | Recommended effort (`thinking`) |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Explore, proposal, archive | Fast and cheap is usually enough.                    | `off` to `low`                  |
| Spec, design, tasks        | Strong reasoning model.                              | `medium` to `high`              |
| Apply                      | Strong coding and tool-use model.                    | `medium` to `high`              |
| Verify / review            | Strong fresh-context model.                          | `high`                          |
| Tiny utilities             | Inherit active/default model unless they bottleneck. | `inherit`                       |

Saved globally at:

```text
~/.pi/gentle-ai/models.json
```

Existing project-local `.pi/gentle-ai/models.json` files are still read as a legacy fallback when no global model config exists, but `/gentle:models` writes the shared global config.

Inside `/gentle:models`, press `x` to export the saved routing to `~/.pi/gentle-ai/models.export.json`, or `r` to restore from that file after confirmation. Export uses a versioned envelope and restore writes the normal `models.json` shape before applying routing to agents.

Config shape (per agent):

```json
{
  "sdd-design": {
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
    "thinking": "high"
  },
  "sdd-archive": {
    "model": "openai/gpt-5-mini"
  }
}
```

Legacy string entries are still accepted and treated as `model`-only config.

## Commands

| Command                          | What it does                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/gentle-ai:status`              | Shows package, SDD asset, OpenSpec, and global model config status. |
| `/gentle-ai:doctor`              | Runs read-only diagnostics for SDD assets, model/persona config, memory tools, and safety guards. |
| `/gentle:models`                 | Opens global model + effort assignment UI. Press `x` to export and `r` to restore saved routing. |
| `/gentle:persona`                | Switches global persona mode, with project override support.        |
| `/gentle:banner`                 | Configures startup banner rose, text logo, and color preset.        |
| `/gentle:toggle-rose`            | Toggles the startup rose.                                           |
| `/gentle:toggle-text-logo`       | Toggles the startup text logo.                                      |
| `/gentle:banner-color`           | Selects a startup banner color preset.                              |
| `/sdd-init`                      | Initializes or refreshes `openspec/config.yaml`.                    |
| `/gentle-ai:install-sdd`         | Repairs missing global SDD runtime assets without overwriting files. |
| `/gentle-ai:install-sdd --force` | Force-refreshes installed global SDD assets.                         |
| `/skill-registry:refresh`        | Regenerates `.atl/skill-registry.md`.                               |

Package-owned global SDD runtime assets are also refreshed automatically on session start when `gentle-pi` changes. Project-local `.pi/agents` and `.pi/chains` remain manual overrides and are never overwritten by startup refresh.

Startup banner settings are global and default to the current pink rose + text logo. Supported color presets are `pink`, `cyan`, `yellow`, and `green`. The `/gentle-ai:*` aliases are also available for every banner command.

Startup flag:

```text
pi --no-skill-registry
```

Use it when you want skills available normally but do not want Gentle AI to refresh/watch `.atl/skill-registry.md` on startup. `pi -ns` / `pi --no-skills` also skip the registry startup work because Pi is already disabling skill loading.

Compatibility aliases:

```text
/gentle-ai:models
/gentleman:models
/gentle-ai:persona
/gentleman:persona
/gentle-ai:banner
/gentle-ai:toggle-rose
/gentle-ai:toggle-text-logo
/gentle-ai:banner-color
```

## Included skills

- `gentle-ai` — harness discipline for controlled Pi work.
- `branch-pr` — issue-first PR preparation.
- `chained-pr` — split oversized changes into reviewable PR chains.
- `work-unit-commits` — commits as reviewable work units.
- `judgment-day` — blind dual review, fixes, and re-judgment.
- `cognitive-doc-design` — documentation that reduces cognitive load.
- `comment-writer` — concise, warm, postable collaboration comments.
- `issue-creation` — issue workflow with checks before creation.

## Memory

`gentle-pi` does **not** provide persistent memory by itself.

For memory, install the companion package:

```bash
pi install npm:gentle-engram
```

When memory tools are actually active, el Gentleman can save decisions, bug fixes, discoveries, user prompts, and session summaries across Pi sessions.

Memory contract for SDD delegation:

- parent/orchestrator owns memory retrieval and passes selected context into subagent prompts;
- subagents should not independently search memory during normal runtime unless explicitly instructed to retrieve a specific artifact or observation;
- subagents should save significant discoveries, decisions, bug fixes, and completed SDD phase artifacts before returning when memory tools are available;
- in memory/hybrid mode, SDD artifacts use stable topic keys such as `sdd/<change>/proposal`, `sdd/<change>/spec`, `sdd/<change>/design`, `sdd/<change>/tasks`, `sdd/<change>/apply-progress`, and `sdd/<change>/verify-report`.

## Development

Install from this repo:

```bash
pi install .
```

Validate before publishing:

```bash
pnpm test
bun build extensions/skill-registry.ts --target=node --format=esm --outfile=/tmp/skill-registry.js
node --experimental-strip-types --check extensions/gentle-ai.ts
node --experimental-strip-types --check extensions/sdd-init.ts
node --experimental-strip-types --check extensions/startup-banner.ts
npm pack --dry-run
```

Publish npm through GitHub Actions only:

```bash
gh workflow run publish.yml --repo Gentleman-Programming/gentle-pi --ref main -f dist-tag=latest
gh run watch <run-id> --repo Gentleman-Programming/gentle-pi --exit-status
npm view gentle-pi@<version> version --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
npm dist-tag ls gentle-pi --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

Do not run `npm publish` locally for `gentle-pi`; the GitHub workflow provides provenance, environment protection, and registry credentials.

## Principles

- Human control over agent momentum.
- Concepts before code.
- Artifacts over floating chat context.
- SDD when risk justifies it.
- Strict TDD when tests exist.
- One parent orchestrator, focused subagents.
- Reviewable changes over giant diffs.
