// Unit 3 — L4 delete backfill (spec C4, design §B3).
//
// C4's contract as a verbatim two-step: a successful delete splices the
// master snapshot AND shrinks the loaded window together; while unloaded
// rows remain, the window backfills one row (clamped) so the next unloaded
// record slides into the deleted slot and the visible list length stays
// stable; at exhaustion (loadedCount == records.length after the decrement)
// there is NO backfill — the visible set genuinely shrinks by one row, by
// design.
//
// The deleted record always comes from filteredRecords ⊆ the loaded prefix,
// so idx < loadedCount by construction (§B3). Change 1's delete contract
// (delete-prompt.ts, error-only notify) is UNTOUCHED — AC-L4-4's regression
// pin is test/history/delete-prompt.test.ts itself, green and unmodified.

// T11 — AC-L4-1 + AC-L4-2: mid-window delete with unloaded rows remaining —
// the count is preserved by pulling the next record: (30, 99) decrements to
// 29, 29 < 99, so backfill min(29 + 1, 99) = 30 (stable window).
